      <p>
        No amount of classroom learning can teach us how to connect with each
        other, Heart to Heart. Mind Education s a set of insightful lectures and
        alternative educational programs that allo us to explore a space that we
        may have forgotten about: "The World of the Heart"
      </p>
      <p>
        Mind Education for adults provides helpful guidance for leadership and
        navigation in the workplace, familial relationships as well as giving
        the tools to mentor younger generations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am looking forward to become a person of influence. Leading Many Souls
        to Christ. Practically, I want to train and educate young people into
        becoming the best God has planned for them to be.
